#CPUInfo
An Android app that displays procinfo and runs top and ps. Since Android's version of top and ps are stripped down versions, don't expect the same experience as using it on Linux.

You can download it at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kritikalerror.cpuinfo

Not sure if I will keep maintaining this.
